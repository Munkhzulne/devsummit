                  We realize that the time allocated to our speakers is simply
                  not enough for them to share their life-long, hard battled
                  experience. Therefore, after every talk we will have our
                  speakers do an AMA session in a different room so that if you
                  are interested to ask questions, exchange ideas or share your
                  experiences you can stop by the AMA session and meet the
                  speakers. Please remember that the AMA session for each
                  speaker will have a limited time as well so be prepared to
                  come with specific questions and be aware of other people who
                  might be lined up behind you to ask questions too.
